# TrajGen_GAIL

### Introduction
Generative model for urban vehicle trajectories based on Deep Learning 
This repository include implementations of :
 - RNN based trajectory generator (Choi et al. 2018) [not yet]
 - MaxEnt inverse reinforcement learning (Ziebart et al. 2008)
 - Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (Ho et al. 2016)
 - ShortestPath World (MDP for routing imitations)
 
### Data availability
Due to the public availability issue of taxi data of Gangnam District, it is not possible to upload the taxi data. 

The available data is a virtual vehicle trajectory data generated by AIMSUN shortest path routing engine.
